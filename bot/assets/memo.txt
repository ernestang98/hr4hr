1. Pay attention to names
Names are one of the first pieces of information that we learn about someone. 
It is how people recognize and address you.
When you tell others your name, include your last name. 
This is especially important if you have a common first name like Ashley or John.
When you first meet someone, pay attention to their name. 
If you aren’t sure how to pronounce it, be sincere and ask.

2. Greet everyone
Greeting the people that you come in contact with isn’t only polite but it establishes rapport. 
You never know who the people that you greeted could be, 
so it is important to greet everyone with the same degree of kindness.
A simple “Hi, how are you?” or even a smile and nod is enough.

3. Offer a handshake and make eye contact
Handshakes are the universal business greeting. 
A firm handshake is still considered a positive trait. A weak one is negative

4. Give cues that show you’re paying attention
When someone else is speaking, it is important to nod or smile. 
This shows that you are engaged and actively listening. 
It tells them that you care about what they say and value their thoughts.

5. Introduce others
No one likes to awkwardly stand with a group of people who have no idea who they are and what they are doing there. 
It’s uncomfortable. If you strike up a conversation with someone and are with a person that they haven’t met yet, 
it is polite to make an introduction
